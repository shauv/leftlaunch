# Startpage
A personal startpage designed to keep my frequently used websites accessible and in one place.

Demo: https://shauv.github.io/startpage

## Features
* **Time and Date:** Displayed above the search bar
* **Search Bar:** Filter and open bookmarks
* **Tetris Minigame:** A retro game to pass the time
* **Virtual Buddy:** A draggable, pettable companion

## Disclaimer
**Note:** At the moment, the startpage is tailored to my personal use. I plan to implement a dedicated configuration file that will allow users to modify various aspects of the startpage.  

Feel free to adapt this project to your own use.
